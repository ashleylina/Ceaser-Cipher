Caesar Cipher in C++
This C++ program implements the Caesar cipher, a basic encryption technique that shifts letters in the alphabet by a specified number of places. It can be used to encode and decode messages securely.

Features:
Encrypts and decrypts text using a user-defined shift key.
Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters while keeping other characters unchanged.
Allows the user to repeat the process or exit as needed.
How to Use:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/AshleyLina/Ceaser-Cipher.git
cd Ceaser-Cipher

Compile the code using g++:
g++ caesar_cipher.cpp -o caesar_cipher

Run the program:
./caesar_cipher

Alternatively, you can use Visual Studio or an online C++ compiler to compile and run the program without needing a terminal.

Example Usage:
Enter the text: hello
Enter the shift key: 3
Choose action: (E)ncode or (D)ecode: E
Encoded text: khoor
